# JBC-Soldering-Controller

The idea of this project is to make a simple JBC soldering station for the T245 and PA120 Micro Tweezers. It runs from a 24V DC power supply.

Tested:

T245 soldering iron


Not tested:

Software - I have kept this because it might be fun to play with at some point, but it is not tested.

AM120 Micro Tweezers (I have not got any yet :( ), although I am confident it will work.


Todo:

Automatically changing the GUI depending on if you are using the standard iron or the tweezers.

Possibly change PCB design to make it fit in a box nicely

Design a case for it
