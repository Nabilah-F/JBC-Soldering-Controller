# JBC-Soldering-Controller

The idea of this project is to make a JBC soldering station for the T245, T210, HT420 and PA120 Micro Tweezers. 
It runs from a 12V to 24V DC power supply.

Tested:

T245 soldering iron



Todo:

Automatically changing the GUI depending on if you are using the standard iron or the tweezers.
Update FW to use tweezers.
